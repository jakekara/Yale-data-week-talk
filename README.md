# Storytelling with data: Data in the newsroom

### The Connecticut Mirror

* We don't shy away from details

### Examples

* Into the weeds: [700,000 CT taxpayers claim a deduction thatâ€™s at risk in D.C.](https://ctmirror.org/2017/08/02/700000-ct-taxpayers-claim-a-deduction-thats-at-risk-in-d-c/) 
* Daily graphics: [Inmate GEDs drop off after test goes online](https://ctmirror.org/2017/12/28/inmate-geds-drop-off-after-test-goes-online/) 
* Interactive: [In Connecticut, a formula helps make bail decisions](https://trendct.org/2017/02/22/in-connecticut-a-formula-helps-make-bail-decisions/) 
* Something splashy: [Bailing out: How bail decisions are made, and re-made](https://github.com/jakekara/small-business-express-loan-analysis/blob/master/Small%20Business%20Express%20Analysis%202.ipynb) -- Compare with [this flow chart](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3455625-Pretrial-Release-and-Detention-in-CT-2-6-2017.html#document/p26) and [this Sankey](https://jakekara.github.io/pretrial-sankey/)
* Mini-database [Explore: 30-year crime trends in Connecticut cities and towns](https://ctmirror.org/2017/09/29/explore-30-year-crime-trends-in-connecticut-cities-and-towns/) 
* Full-on web apps: [Schools database](https://schools.ctmirror.org), [Election data portal](https://blogotron.ctmirror.org/election-2016/page/us-house/)

### Pathway to data journalism

* Journalist + Excel = Data Journalist
* Data Journalist - Excel + PANDAS = Better data journalist
* __PSA: If you have a techy-sounding job title, people will ask you to fix the printer__
* Why journalists use notebook: accuracy, establishing a record
* Example of data [notebook](https://github.com/jakekara/small-business-express-loan-analysis/blob/master/Small%20Business%20Express%20Analysis%202.ipynb)

### Caveats: Data is the answer!

* Psych, no it's not.
* Beware that a number is really convincing
* Express uncertainty in understandable terms
* Bad data example: Incomplete firearm data made it look like there had been a massive drop
* Bad data example: Duplicate comptroller data made it [look like state spent 2x its budget!](https://github.com/trendct-data/comptroller-data-problem)
* Data is just like a human source, torture it long enough and it will tell
  you anything you want to hear.
